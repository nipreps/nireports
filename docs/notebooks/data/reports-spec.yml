      fMRI duration after censoring computed as the number of good timepoints multiplied by the repetition time (TR). 
      The red line corresponds to the QC cutoff of 5 minutes (300 seconds). Less than 5 minutes of fMRI is not enough to 
      reliably estimate connectivity.

      QC-FC plots tested functional connectivity associations with three image quality metrics (fd_mean, fd_num, and
      fd_perc). Plots were generated from functional data from all sessions. Red dotted lines represent a theoretical 
      artifact-free null-hypothesis distribution obtained through permutation analyses. QC-FC percent match level represents the distance
      between the observed and the null-hypothesis distribution and is computed using the R implementation of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
      test for goodness of fit. Red label indicates that the QC-FC distribution did not reach above the 95% cutoff.

      Correlation between QC-FC and Euclidean distance separating nodes. The euclidean distance is computed from the centers of mass 
      of each region in the atlas used to compute the FC.
