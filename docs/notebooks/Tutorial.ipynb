The goal with the next reportlet is to verify whether each session has enough timepoints after censoring to reliably estimate FC. If not, that session needs to be identified and excluded. We use plotly to generate an interactive plot in which hovering on the points tells you the session it corresponds to. The interactivity would not be possible with an image that is why we store the reportlet in HTML format."
