# The *NiPreps Community*'s Governance Documents [PROPOSAL/WORKING DOCUMENT]

The *NiPreps Community*'s Governance Documents are derived from the [Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) project](https://github.com/github/MVG), adapted following the discussion within the *NiPreps Governance task-force*, and finally passed by the first elect- Steering Committee on [DATE].

The MVG foundation provides an overall three-tier organizational governance structure for a set of free and open source components of the *NiPreps Framework*.
At the top level (called an "organization" on GitHub; [github.com/nipreps](https://github.com/nipreps/)), there is a technical steering committee to make decisions about the overall direction and coordination between all the organization's projects.
Underneath that top level are the individual projects (e.g., [nipreps/fmriprep](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep)), with lightweight, consensus-based governance.
The third tier are "sibling organizations" (e.g., [TemplateFlow](https://github.com/templateflow/), which have the structure of GitHub "organizations" but the governance of individual projects (i.e., lightweight, consensus-based).

There documents are organized in three folders. The first, `org-docs/`, provides top-level organizational governance and polices for a technical steering committee (TSC).
The second folder, `project-docs/`, provides a template for individual project governance, subject to the polices and oversight of the larger organization.
The third folder, `sibling-docs/`, provides a minimal template for the governance of sibling organizations, subject to the policies and oversight of the *NiPreps* organization.
